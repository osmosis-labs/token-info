Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.\n\nAs a true appchain, Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than traditional smart contract DEXs, which must follow the code of the parent chain that it is built on. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of Superfluid Staking, an extension of Proof of Stake that allows assets at the application layer to be staked to secure the chain. The customizability of appchains also allows implementing features like the Protocol Revenue module, which enables Osmosis to conduct on-chain arbitrage on behalf of OSMO stakers, balancing prices across pools while generating real yield revenue from this volume. Additionally, as a sovereign appchain, Osmosis governance can vote on upgrades to the protocol. One example of this was the introduction of a Taker Fee, which switched on the collection of exchange fees to generate diverse yield from Osmosis volume and distribute it to OSMO stakers.\n\nOsmosis is bringing the full centralized exchange experience to the decentralized world by building a cross-chain native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To reach this goal, Osmosis hosts an ever-expanding suite of DeFi applications aimed at providing a one-stop experience that includes lending, credit, margin, DeFi strategy vaults, power perps, fiat on-ramps, NFTs, stablecoins, and more — all of the functionalities that centralized exchange offer and more, in the trust-minimized environment of decentralized finance.",

Pyth has multiple data publishers for every product to improve the accuracy and robustness of the system.\n-Pyth's oracle program combines publishers' data to produce a single aggregate price and confidence interval.\nConsumers read the price information produced by the oracle program.\n\nPyth's oracle program runs simultaneously on both Solana mainnet and Pythnet. Each instance of the program is responsible for its own set of price feeds. Solana Price Feeds are available for use by Solana protocols. In this case, since the oracle program itself runs on Solana, the resulting prices are immediately available to consumers without requiring any additional work. Pythnet Price Feeds are available on 12+ blockchains. The prices constructed on Pythnet are transferred cross-chain to reach consumers on these blockchains.\n\nIn both cases, the critical component of the system is the oracle program that combines the data from each individual publisher. This program maintains a number of different Solana accounts that list the products on Pyth and their current price data. Publishers publish their price and confidence by interacting with the oracle program on every slot. The program stores this information in its accounts. The first price update in a slot additionally triggers price aggregation, which combines the price data from the previous slot into a single aggregate price and confidence interval. This aggregate price is written to the Solana account where it is readable by other on-chain programs and available for transmission to other blockchains.",

Pioneering in its approach, Osmosis offers a dynamic trading and liquidity provision experience, integrating non-IBC assets from other ecosystems, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. Initially adopting Balancer-style pools, Osmosis now also features a concentrated liquidity model that is orders of magnitude more capital efficient, meaning that significantly less liquidity is required to handle the same amount of trading volume with minimal slippage.\n\nAs a true appchain, Osmosis has greater control over the full blockchain stack than traditional smart contract DEXs, which must follow the code of the parent chain that it is built on. This fine-grained control has enabled, for example, the development of Superfluid Staking, an extension of Proof of Stake that allows assets at the application layer to be staked to secure the chain. The customizability of appchains also allows implementing features like the Protocol Revenue module, which enables Osmosis to conduct on-chain arbitrage on behalf of OSMO stakers, balancing prices across pools while generating real yield revenue from this volume. Additionally, as a sovereign appchain, Osmosis governance can vote on upgrades to the protocol. One example of this was the introduction of a Taker Fee, which switched on the collection of exchange fees to generate diverse yield from Osmosis volume and distribute it to OSMO stakers.\n\nOsmosis is bringing the full centralized exchange experience to the decentralized world by building a cross-chain native DEX and trading suite that connects all chains over IBC, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. To reach this goal, Osmosis hosts an ever-expanding suite of DeFi applications aimed at providing a one-stop experience that includes lending, credit, margin, DeFi strategy vaults, power perps, fiat on-ramps, NFTs, stablecoins, and more — all of the functionalities that centralized exchange offer and more, in the trust-minimized environment of decentralized finance.",

Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner, unlike traditional cloud storage providers.\n\nParticipants in the Filecoin network are incentivized to act honestly and store as much data as possible because they earn the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) in exchange for their storage services. This setup ensures the integrity and accessibility of data stored. Filecoin's model allows for a variety of storage options, including long-term archival storage and more rapid retrieval services, making it a versatile solution for decentralized data storage.

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was designed to be a platform for applications that can operate without the need for intermediaries, using blockchain technology. This has made Ethereum a leading platform for various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and more.

It aims to offer an antidote to slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful proof-of-work protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.\n\nThe project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Inter-blockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.\n\nCosmos Hub's origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance.",
